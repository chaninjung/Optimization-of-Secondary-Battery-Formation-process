## A project to reduce the defect rate of the secondary battery by optimizing the Formation process

After checking the facilities and process conditions that affect defects in the production of secondary batteries, we carried out a big data project to reduce the existing defect rate of 3.12% to 0.45%. To this end, we explored and analyzed the facility significance difference with big data from the Formation process during the secondary battery production process and created a prediction model that reduces the defect rate with XGBoost.
